> The Farmers E-Helper is created to help bring together all local vendors. We want to help make each stronger individually as a collective whole by providing simple lines of communication, logistics and support within the relationship of producers to buyers and producers to producers & essentially creating an online farmers market for that offers consistent connection between all producers and buyers. The main motive of the project is to sell local and buy local
